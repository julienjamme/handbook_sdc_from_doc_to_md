<section id="introduction" class="level2" data-number="6.1">
<h2 data-number="6.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Although very sophisticated methods have been developed to make safe micro data files, the needs of serious researchers for more detailed data cannot be met by these methods. It is simply impossible to release these very detailed micro data sets to users outside the control of the NSIs without breaching the necessary confidentiality protection. Nevertheless the NSIs recognize the serious and respectable requests by the research community for access to the very rich and valuable micro data sets of the NSIs. Therefore different initiatives have been taken by the NSIs to meet these needs.</p>
<p>The first step was the creation of so-called safe data research centres, a special room in the NSI, where researchers can analyse the data sets, without the option to export any information without the consent of the NSI. In parallel to this initiative there are options for remote execution. Remote execution facilities are various kinds of systems where researchers can submit scripts for SAS, SPSS etc to the NSI. The most recent initiative is remote access, where users can “log in” to a research centre from a remote desktop.</p>
<p>As all these options allow the researcher to access unprotected sensitive data in some way, all possible precautions have to be taken. These options are certainly not available to the general public, but only to selected research institutes like universities and similar research institutes. Additionally, strict contracts have to be signed between the NSI and the researcher. Preferably also the research institute itself should sign the contract. This enables the NSI to take action against the institute itself as well as against the researcher, if something might go wrong. A common repercussion for the institute could be a ban for the whole institute to access these facilities. So it will be in the interest of the institute to ensure a correct behaviour of the researcher.</p>

<section id="research-centres" class="level2" data-number="6.2">
<h2 data-number="6.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="research-centres"><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Research centres</h2>
<p>In order to meet the needs of the researcher community to analyse the rich data sets compiled by the NSIs, while safeguarding the confidentiality constraints, the first solution was to create special rooms in the premises of the NSIs (research centres) The NSI makes available special computers for the researchers. On this computer the necessary software for the research will be installed by the NSI together with the necessary data sets. Ideally these computers have no connection whatsoever to the internet and there is no email. Also drives for removable discs (floppy or CD) are not available and the use of memory sticks has to be blocked. The access to the internal production network of the NSI has to be blocked as well, preventing the possibilities of the researchers to access other sensitive information. Installing a printer is a risk as well as is the use of phones. If there is enough supervision, these two options could be made available. Nevertheless some kind of supervision on the research centre is always needed.</p>
<p>The data sets to be used in the research centre have to be anonymised (i.e.&nbsp;at least the name address etc are removed). It is also advisable to restrict the variables available to the set that is needed for the specific research.</p>
<p>On these computers the researchers should neverthe­less be able to fully analyse the data files and complete their analysis. When the research is finished the results have to be released to the researchers. Before this can be done, NSI staff has to check the research results. Unfortunately this is not a straightforward, easy task. This will be discussed in section 6.6</p>
<p>The concept of research centres is meeting many research needs and several NSIs have adopted this idea. Without being complete this imitative has been implemented in the USA, Canada, The Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Eurostat and several other countries.</p>
<p>The concept of research centres has proved to be very successful. Many good research papers and theses have been completed for which these centres were indispensable. However there are some drawbacks. The most important one is that the researchers have to come physically to the premises of the NSIs. Even in a small country like the Netherlands, this is seen as a serious problem. Also the researcher cannot just try another option when he is back at his normal working place, because he has to travel to the NSI first. Also the fact that he cannot work in his normal working environment is considered a drawback.</p>
</section>
<section id="remote-execution" class="level2" data-number="6.3">
<h2 data-number="6.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="remote-execution"><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Remote execution</h2>
<p>As modern communication techniques have become available, the NSIs have investigated the possibilities to use these techniques. The first initiative is remote execution. In this concept the researchers will get a full description of all the meta data of the data sets available for research. However the data set available will remain on the computers of the NSIs. The researchers will prepare scripts for analysing the data sets (with SPSS, SAS etc) and send them to the NSI (by email or via some internet page). The NSI will then check the script (e.g.&nbsp;for commands like List Cases, but also other unwanted actions like printing the residuals of a regression) before running it and after a second check send back the results to the researcher.</p>
<p>For the researcher this system has the advantage that he does no longer have to travel to the NSI. He can send a script whenever he wants. On the other hand he cannot directly run the script since this is done by the NSI. Hence correcting errors in a script can take much more time, depending of the turn around time of the NSI. This process could be speeded up if the NSI will make available a fake dataset which corresponds to the original file in terms of structure but not in content. The main objective of this data set is to avoid all unsuccessful submissions due to syntax errors etc.</p>
<p>For the researcher remote execution has several advantages (no need for travel) but also some drawbacks (slow turn around time). For the NSIs it is very time-consuming, as they have to check so many scripts and results. It is not uncommon in statistical analysis that several scripts are submitted and executed. But then the outcome proves to be not the optimal model and a new script is submitted. However the NSI does not know in advance which script is successful and has to check everything. This is very time-consuming if the NSI takes this seriously.</p>
<p>Current examples of this kind of systems are the Luxembourg Income Study (Lissy) and the Australian RADL.</p>

<section id="remote-access" class="level2" data-number="6.4">
<h2 data-number="6.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="remote-access"><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Remote access</h2>
<p>Recent new developments are systems for remote access. The aim is to combine the flexibility for researchers to do all their analysis in a research centre while removing the constraints of travelling to the NSIs. Modern developments in the internet make it possible to set up a safe controlled connection, a VPN (virtual private network). A VPN is a technique to setup a secure connection between the server at the NSI and a computer of the researcher. It uses firewalls and encryption techniques. Also additional procedures to control the login procedure like software tokens or biometrics can be used to secure the connection. The most well know product behind this is Citrix, but other systems exist as well. Citrix has been developed to set up safe access to business networks over the internet without giving access to unauthorised persons. This will safeguard the confidentiality of the information on this network.</p>
<p>Some NSIs are now using Citrix to set up a safe connection between the PC of the researcher and a protected server of the NSI. This approach is followed now by Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands and Slovenia.</p>
<p>The main idea of a remote facility is that it should resemble the ‘traditional’ OnSite research centres as much as possible, concerning confidentiality aspects.</p>
<p>The following aspects have to be taken into account:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Only authorized users should be able to make use of this facility,</p></li>
<li><p>Microdata should remain at the NSI,</p></li>
<li><p>Desired output of analyses should be checked on confidentiality,</p></li>
<li><p>Legal measures have to be taken when allowing access.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The key issue is that the micro data set remains in the controlled environment of the NSI, while the researcher can do the analysis in his institute. In fact it is an equivalent of the research centre. The Citrix connection will enable the researcher to run SPSS, SAS etc on the server of the NSI. The researcher will only see the session on his screen. This allows him to see the results on his analysis but also the microdata itself. This is completely equivalent to what he can see, if he would be at the research centre.</p>
<p>Citrix will only send the pictures of the screens to the PC of the researcher, but no data is send to him. Even copying the data from the screen to the hard disk is not possible. If the researcher is satisfied with some analysis and wants to use the results in his report, he should make a request to the NSI to release these results to him. The NSI has to check the output for disclosure risks and if this is OK the NSI will send the results to the researcher.</p>
<p>As the researchers will work with very sensitive data, all measures should be taken to ensure the confidentiality of the data. Therefore also legal measures have to be taken, binding not only the researcher himself but also the institute.</p>

<h2 data-number="6.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="licensing"><span class="header-section-number">6.5</span> Licensing</h2>
<p>Another access option for microdata releases available to NSIs is to release data under licence or access agreements. A spectrum of different data access arrangements can be provided. A variety of factors should be taken into account when granting approval for access – including the purpose of the access, the status of the user, the legal framework, the status of the data, the availability of facilities and the history of access. The levels of control over use and user applied within the licence should be balanced by the level of detail and/or perturbation in the microdata.</p>

<h4 data-number="6.6.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-1"><span class="header-section-number">6.6.1.1</span> Introduction</h4>
<p>As in many other countries, German official data are subject to statutory data protection regulations. Therefore, results produced on the basis of statistical data are checked for confidentiality and critical values are suppressed. This applies both to publications of the statistical offices and to the results of scientific projects supported by the research data centres (RDC) of German official statistics. Since the research data centres were set up in Germany in 2001, microdata requests from the scientific community have considerably increased. In this context, researchers do their own analyses of microdata coming from the wide range of statistics offered by the research data centres. In Germany, various ways of data access have been established for researchers. A way of access frequently used is controlled teleprocessing - or controlled remote data processing - , which runs on non-anonymised original data thus giving the researcher the opportunity to exploit the full information content of official microdata. For controlled remote data processing the user first of all gets a data structure file from the research data centre whose structure is that of the original file, but whose content is not. Based on that file, the data user develops a program code using the statistics software SAS, SPSS or STATA, checks it for errors and sends it to the research data centre via e-mail. The output of his program is then checked for confidentiality and returned also by e-mail. Checking the produced results for confidentiality is done manually.</p>
<p>Manual confidentiality checks are time-consuming and labour-intensive, as is shown in chapter 6.3. The responsible staff member must be familiar with both the analysed statistics and the specific research project. He must ensure primary and secondary confidentiality and keep track of the secondary confidentiality protection performed even with repeated outputs. In particular, he must check the transmitted program code for intentional and unintentional disclosure of the data. The experience of the research data centres of official statistics in Germany shows that the projects dealt with are very different in terms of volume and complexity of the transmitted programs. In some cases, there is much need for clarification and, depending on how the project proceeds, a variety of individual arrangements must be made with the data user. A more or less long start-up and acquaintance phase on both sides is necessary in every project. Combining that experience at the research data centres has led to the wish to reduce both the adjustment phase and the checking times by standardising the program design.</p>

<section id="rules-for-program-design" class="level4" data-number="6.6.1.2">
<h4 data-number="6.6.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rules-for-program-design"><span class="header-section-number">6.6.1.2</span> Rules for program design</h4>
<p><em><strong>Goals</strong></em></p>
<p>To simplify project handling, and especially the confidentiality checks, the research data centres of the Federation and the Länder have developed a catalogue of rules for program design when using controlled teleprocessing<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Its purpose is to allow:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to shape the envisaged analysis steps in a traceable manner,</p></li>
<li><p>to facilitate readability of the user-specific “programming handwritings”,</p></li>
<li><p>to apply uniform standards to projects performed at different locations of the research data centres of the Federation and the Länder,</p></li>
<li><p>and, where necessary, to change the project staff at the RDC without causing delays in the project progress.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The benefits obtained from those rules for the research data centres involve a considerable advantage for users, too: The checking time for the output, for which users undoubtedly are urgently waiting for, will substantially be reduced.</p>
<p><em><strong>Program heading</strong></em></p>
<p>Specifically, the following requirements have been included in the rules:</p>
<p>The program developed by the researcher should include a program heading, indicating the project title, the data material used, and contact information of the data user. The project title and the information on data material used allow rapid identification of the program at the research data centre. The contact information is important because in case of faulty programs the user can immediately be contacted by telephone or e-mail in order to agree on modifications.</p>
<p><em><strong>Program explanation</strong></em></p>
<p>Also, a program explanation should be provided at the beginning of the program, describing its purpose. Where applicable, information is also required on how the current analyses fit into the project’s state of affairs and progress, on the reference to previous and future analyses, or possible changes in the analysis strategy. The explanation should also contain a list of variables of the original data set used and of the new variables created by the program code, including its labels. Such information facilitates orientation when checking the results. Repeated analyses involving minor changes will more easily be recognised and cross-table confidentiality, which requires comparison with previous outputs, can be performed more rapidly. The names and contents of newly formed variables are more easily recognised by the checking person if they have been mentioned before.</p>
<p><em><strong>Output tables</strong></em></p>
<p>The output tables should meet specific format requirements. Every output element should have a title and a serial number. Tables must be self-explanatory, i.e.&nbsp;the table stub and rows must clearly show the table content. Tables should be manageable, that is, they must not exceed a reasonable size. Tables showing totals must have a column for the underlying number of cases to allow checking the frequency and dominance rules. These requirements are based, among other things, on the experience made with confidentiality checks of poorly structured and oversized tables. Output numbering has proved necessary to allow referring to a number when communicating with the data user, rather than having to describe in detail the content of an analysis (often quite similar to other ones) to identify the table.</p>
<p><em><strong>Path reference</strong></em></p>
<p>Path references to files used should be put at the beginning of the program. This provides an overview of what files are loaded by the program and what files are stored. This allows the research data centre to adjust the paths (which is frequently necessary) more rapidly than when having to search the entire program for load and store commands.</p>
<p><em><strong>Structure</strong></em></p>
<p>The program code should be clearly structured visually; loops should be indented and some space should be left between program blocks. Capital and small letters should be used consistently, program sections should be numbered, and long programs should be subdivided into modules. This, together with the following three items, will allow reducing the time required for getting acquainted with different programming styles and for understanding the program goals and output content.</p>
<p><em><strong>Comments</strong></em></p>
<p>Comments should be given on the program. All program blocks and individual commands needing explanation or analyses should be provided with intelligible and sufficiently detailed comments to facilitate understanding of the program steps. Especially the macros must be documented in detail. Variables must be indicated with their labels in the comment.</p>
<p><em><strong>Variable names</strong></em></p>
<p>Descriptive names should be given to newly formed variables; intelligible variable labels and, where applicable, value labels should be added.</p>
<p><em><strong>Presentation</strong></em></p>
<p>Designations of elements used in the code should not be changed (example: relations [everywhere either “<span class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span>” or “GT”], missing values [<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(-x\)</span>], etc.).</p>
<p><em><strong>Logging</strong></em></p>
<p>The log function of the statistics software (creating log files) must be activated by the user’s program code or in any case must not be deactivated, depending on the statistics software. Creating the logs allows archiving the project, so that possible disclosures can be detected later.</p>
<p><em><strong>Changing the code</strong></em></p>
<p>Where minor changes are applied to the program, only the relevant program elements should be recalculated. The usual procedure for one’s own workplace is to perform complete runs of a program with minor changes again and again until a satisfactory result has been obtained. For controlled teleprocessing, however, this means that nearly identical outputs have to be checked again and again.</p>

<h4 data-number="6.6.1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary"><span class="header-section-number">6.6.1.3</span> Summary</h4>
<p>Different from the program rules required by automated systems, these rules do not completely block certain procedures and commands. Manual handling allows taking individual decisions – when calling up critical procedures, and depending on the data or the specific analysis – to what extent the analysis results thus obtained can be transmitted to the user or must be retained for confidentiality reasons. In this manner, users can make optimal use of the information content of the data.</p>
<p>Supplementary to the catalogue of rules, a model program (cf. <a href="#sec-programmingSPSS" class="quarto-xref"><span>Section 6.6.1.4</span></a>) has been designed and is available for the statistics packages offered (SPSS, STATA and SAS). In addition, a glossary is provided, containing the terms used in the jargon of official statistics, in programming languages and statistical packages, scientific notation and everyday language and translating them into each other.</p>
<p>The program criteria developed are sent in the form of a letter to the researchers and are part of the data usage contract. The purpose of the letter is to ask users for understanding of the list of rules, to avoid misunderstandings from the beginning, and to rapidly and efficiently make users acquainted with the rules of controlled teleprocessing, which may be quite different from the work methods they are used to at their own workplace. When developing the criteria, the model programs and the glossary, the aim was to make them generally acceptable, thus making it easier for the very different scientific users to meet the requirements.</p>
<p>From the viewpoint of the research data centres, the individual items are maximum requirements for developing perfect program codes. If the criteria are not entirely met in some cases, it is up to the discretion of the RDC staff member to decide to what extent it is possible for him to check the results. As the research projects are handled individually and personally, interpreting the rules to the users’ benefit is rather liberal. If, however, a project is getting very difficult to follow, the research data centres may refer to the rules that must be adhered to.</p>
